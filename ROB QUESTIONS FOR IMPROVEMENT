ROB QUESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:

Show me math for AFM tip parameters [AFM_INPUT.m]
[READ Costa AZ paper for calculation and implementation]


Heatmaps are flipped along x-axis when compared to matrix data [AFM_POST_JONv4.m]


How to change depth considered for PWM ??
stops around trigger_point


How to recreate F-D with hertz fit -and- PWM points ??
[calc_E_app] where linear versions are calculated




Compare PWM v. Hertz_Lin (% diff) using RSQ as Hertz filter?
YES first filter from 0.95 Hz

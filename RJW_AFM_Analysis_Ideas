Q: Create shell script to multiconvert (all in directory) using ARDFtoHDF5.exe
A: Done, ps file now in github directory

Q: Show me math for AFM tip parameters [AFM_INPUT.m]
A: (Jon) From KDC AZ paper for calculation and implementation

Q: Heatmaps are flipped along x-axis when compared to matrix data [AFM_POST_JONv4.m]


Q: How to change depth considered for PWM ?
A: (Jon) Stops around trigger point

Q: How to recreate F-D with hertz fit -and- PWM points ?
A: (Jon) see 'calc_E_app' for where linear versions are calculated

Q: Based on 'calc_E_app' answer can we compare PWM to Hertz_Lin (% difference) using rsq as Hertz Filter ?
A: I implemented this in a basic analysis for only Hertz_lin fit data, but did not compare to PWM. I think the D_max PWM will be comparable to the Hertz_lin fit and moving forward will use PWM.

Version 2 attempts to fit the contact point better.

2020-05-19: Added a check on the baseline deflection calculation based on the
standard deviation of the poitns considered.

Version 2.1

2020-05-19: Adds the option of calculating modulus assuming ideal
Hertzian contact. That is, fitting the data to the best fit quadratic
rather than the actual raw data.

2020-05-19: Fixed a missing parentheses in modulus calculation that was
causing Elastic modulus to trend to 0
2020-05-20: changed some font sizes in plots, turned off warnings and
beginning and back on at end of script.

Version 2.2 
2020-05-21: Changed the main loop from for to parfor and added graphical
visualization of all data with imagesc plot at the end.


--------------------

Version 3

2020-05-26: Major changes to the flow. Create an input file that is read outside
that contains the parameters, inputs, options, etc. Divide segments up into 
individual codes separate from the main script. Also changed how iteration was performed - 
no longer going through a list of strings.

2020-05-27: Changes to how quadratic fit is added. Changed some of the segments into an outside function call.
Added the option of calculating the results for pointwise and fitted data. Added imagesc plots at the end.

Version 3.1: Adding in the ability to save plots.
2020-05-29: Added the option to calculate a single E calculation by using linearized form of the equations.
2020-06-02: Stored contact points to be able to plot height.

Version 3.2: 
2020-06-02: Changed how the single point (Hertzian) Elastic modulus is calculated. Previously, it was fit to a quadratic curve.
Seeing as this only makes sense in the cone case, I removed this and there is no fitting applied.
-calc_E_app now has a plotting option to it for looking at the linearized form when assuming Hertz.

2020-06-04: Switched back to using segment index for defining end of indentation. If using previous method, which 
defines the end as when the  piezo voltage stops increasing, can lead to decreasing depth in the indentaiton. 
See https://mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Jonathan%2520Haydak's%2520Book/OTYuMnw1NDM0MjIvNzQtNDA5L1RyZWVOb2RlLzE0NjU5MjY1NDd8MjQ0LjI=
-Changed the plotting to reverse the y axis, so as to compare with images from IGOR (origin for Igor is bottom left, not top left)
-Add the ability to return r^2 for linear single value Hertzian Elastic modulus calculation

2020-06-05: Fixed issue where one row and one column of data were being ignored because of off by one error.
2020-06-06: By fixing the issue, I realize now that some of the force curves are missing that were overlooked before.
This is causing the code to error out. I will have to add a line of code for error checking.
- Run into the issue of VERY early indentations : add error checking to filter out these cases.

H5G_loc_find_cb
    object '45:0' doesn't
    exist
    H5G_traverse_real
    traversal operator failed
    H5G_traverse
    internal path traversal
    failed
    H5G_loc_find
    can't find object
    H5Dopen2             not
    found

2020-06-11: Save the Ratio of Variance and extension plot in a cell array

2020-06-14: I was using any(contains(FCnames_str,this))) to check that the h5 file contained the indentation.
However, this is wrong. For example : indentation '3:53' is missing, but '23:53' is present - will get a false positive.
CHANGED to any(strcmp(FCnames_str,this)).

2021-04-12: Added some goddamn explanation of what the fucking variables that are saved mean.

Version 4:

2021-04-20 : After meeting with Rob + Smiti, the program sometimes omits significant portions of precontact curve. PAY ATTENTION to # of points considered.

2021-04-21 : Bug where if the desired number of points > number of points in raw file it would return empty values. Fixed this. Problem with with offsetting a negative index.

2021-04-22 : Changed behaviour so that if MAX_DEFL_FIT is not met, it will use the entire force curve.

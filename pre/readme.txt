Thanks David, you put this out at exactly the right time for me. Could you explain how to interpret the /ForceMaps/Segments dataset?

EDIT: In an email reply, David explained:

The ForceMap/Segments attribute (not the dataset) has: Ext, Ret, Away
Ext is extension
Ret is retraction
Away I would assume is a dwell time after retraction but I can check if that doesnâ€™t sound right.

So the first number in the ForceMap/Segments dataset is what data index corresponds to the end of the extension phase, the next is for the end of retraction, etc.

Force maps can have up to 4 segments but yours is only using 3. This conversion tool is [...] giving a 4th value of 0 for the unused segment.
